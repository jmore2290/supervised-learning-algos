This is the assignment for Lesson 9: Lab 1
Here I have created a decision tree classifier on a dataset with the goal of predicting what type of iris a plant will be given a set of features.  I've used bagging on this (an ensemble technique).
I've also used KNN, KNN w/bagging and Logistic Regression on the dataset with the following results:
Decision Tree:
Average Accuracy: 0.96
STD: 0.02

Decision Tree w/bagging:
Average Accuracy: 0.95
STD: 0.0339

KNN Classifier w/5 neighbors-- Varying K beyond of below 5 does not seen to benefit the classifier:
Average Accuracy: 0.97
STD: 0.0249

KNN Classifier w/bagging:
Average Accuracy: 0.986
STD: 0.0163

Logistic Regression:
Average Accuracy: 0.96
STD: 0.038
