Presented here, I am using a Naive Bayes Classifier to accurately classify SMSs as either spam or ham. I have managed to get ~ 92% accuracy by taking advantage of the fact that many SMS messages in the data set want the mobile user to click on a link or take some critical action. The way I actually managed to classify my data can be seen in the method sms_features.
